## Title

According to wikipedia 'Aleatoric music (also aleatory music or chance music; from the Latin word alea, meaning "dice") is music in which some element of the composition is left to chance, and/or some primary element of a composed work's realization is left to the determination of its performer(s). The term is most often associated with procedures in which the chance element involves a relatively limited number of possibilities.'


Here sounds are created by the bouncing of balls on the screen. Cleverly combining these two things I called this piece aleatoricBounce.

## Game

Loosely gamified aleatoric computer music. There is a white square and some balls bouncing around. You control a rectangle, if you get it in the square you gain some lives, if a ball gets in the square, you lose a life and an extra ball is added. As the balls bounce they trigger Tone.js synthesised sounds. Part game, part composition, part web-site.
